# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms. The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle. It contains 284,807 transactions, among which 492 are fraudulent. The dataset has been preprocessed and anonymized, and the features include Time, Amount, and 28 anonymized features (V1, V2, ..., V28).

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (fraud or not fraud).
Decision Tree: A non-linear model that splits the data into branches to make predictions based on the input features.
Steps:

Load and explore the dataset.
Preprocess the data (handling missing values, scaling, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the Logistic Regression model and Decision Tree model.
Evaluate the performance of both models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compare the performance of the models and select the best one for deployment.
